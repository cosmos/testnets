# Testnet Demo Day # 12: 2025-Jan-28

In this demo day, we will demonstrate two of the features introduced in Interchain Security v6.4.0:
* Customizable slashing and jailing
* Power shaping via priority list 

We will post announcements in the `testnet-announcements` channel in Discord to coordinate activities during the event.

* Start time: `2025-01-28 14:00 UTC`
* End time: `2025-01-28 16:00 UTC`

## Customizable Slashing and Jailing

We have launched a chain called `test-infraction-1` with strict slashing parameters to demonstrate the [infraction parameters](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-020-cutomizable_slashing_and_jailing) feature of Interchain Security:
* A validator only needs to go offline for about a minute to get jailed for downtime.
* A downtime infraction will result in a 10% slash.

We will ask participants to delegate stake to the `sleepy ðŸ¥±` validator (`cosmosvaloper1hv3ghgjgy4rpkw8v3f59x6ajtcv6pjyzuvvh9p`), and then we will stop its `test-infraction-1` node to trigger the 10% slashing.

## Power Shaping via Priority List

We have launched a chain called `test-priority-1` with a validator set cap of 11 to demonstrate the [priority list](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/features/power-shaping#prioritylist) feature of Interchain Security.

We will ask participants to opt-in to the `test-priority-1` chain. We will submit several update consumer transactions throughout the event to add different sets of validators to the priority list and trigger an update to the `test-priority-1` validator set.

```
* (1 point) Task 2: Opt-in to the `test-priority-1` consumer chain before it is removed.
```
