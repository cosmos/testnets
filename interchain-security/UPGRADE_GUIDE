# How to upgrade your node

There are two major kinds of upgrades:
* Governance gated
* Non-governance gated

## Governance Gated Upgrade

A governance gated upgrade occurs when an upgrade plan goes on chain through a software upgrade proposal.
* Your node **will** stop at the height listed in the upgrade plan.

You can upgrade your node by replacing the binary manually or using Cosmovisor.

### Manual Binary Upgrade

1. Build or download the binary for the release you are upgrading to.
2. Wait for the node to stop at the upgrade height.
  * The log will display something like this:
    ```
    ERR UPGRADE "v22" NEEDED at height: <UPGRADE_HEIGHT>: upgrade to v22 and applying upgrade "v22" at height:<UPGRADE_HEIGHT>
    ```
  * If the node service remains active, you can stop it now.
3. Replace the binary listed in the unit file with the new release.
4. Start the node service again.

### Cosmovisor Upgrade

1. Build or download the binary for the release you are upgrading to.
2. Create a folder for the new binary in the relevant Cosmovisor directory.
  * If the upgrade name is `v22`, you would place the binary under `<node home>/cosmovisor/upgrades/v22/bin/gaiad`:
    ```
    .
    ├── current -> genesis or upgrades/<name>
    ├── genesis
    │   └── bin
    │       └── gaiad  # old: v21.0.1
    └── upgrades
        └── v22
            └── bin
                └── gaiad  # new: v22.0.0
    ```
3. Verify that Cosmovisor will use the binary you have prepared.
  * The Cosmovisor service should have the auto-download feature disabled. A sample Cosmovisor unit file will look like this:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Cosmovisor service
    After=network-online.target
    
    [Service]
    User=gaia
    ExecStart=/gaia/go/bin/cosmovisor run start --home /gaia/.gaia
    Restart=no
    LimitNOFILE=50000
    Environment='DAEMON_NAME=gaiad'
    Environment='DAEMON_HOME=/gaia/.gaia'
    Environment='DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=false'
    Environment='DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true'
    Environment='DAEMON_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE=512'
    Environment='UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true'
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
  * If you must change the contents of the unit file, run `systemctl daemon-reload` before restarting the service.
4. Wait for the node to reach the upgrade height. Cosmovisor will restart the node using the new binary.


## Non-governance Gated Upgrade

A non-governance gated upgrade occurs when nodes upgrade their binary at an agreed-upon height.

* You **must** stop your node at the relevant height and replace the binary before starting it again.
* ⚠️ Monitor your logs when the halt height is about to be reached. If your node does not stop at the specified height using the instructions below, stop the service manually and replace the binary before starting the service again.

### Manual Binary Upgrade

1. Build or download the binary for the release you are upgrading to.
2. Stop the node service.
3. Update the service to add the `--halt height` flag. 
   * A sample Gaia unit file will look like this for an upgrade height of `24385600`:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Gaia service
    After=network-online.target
    
    [Service]
    User=gaia
    ExecStart=/gaia/go/bin/gaiad start --home /gaia/.gaia --halt-height 24385600
    Restart=no
    LimitNOFILE=4096
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
4. Run `systemctl daemon-reload` and restart the service.
5. Wait for the halt height. 
   * The log will display something like this when height is reached:
    ```
    ERR CONSENSUS FAILURE!!! err="failed to apply block; error halt per configuration height 24385600 time 0" 
    ```
7. Stop the node service.
8. Replace the binary listed in the unit file with the new release.
9. Update the service to remove the `--halt-height <height>` argument.
10. Run `systemctl daemon-reload` and restart the service.

### Cosmovisor Upgrade


1. Build or download the binary for the release you are upgrading to.
   * For this example, we will use a binary file named `gaiad-v22.1.0-linux-amd64` and an upgrade name of `v22.1.0`.
2. Run the Cosmovisor `add-upgrade` command.
   * For an upgrade height of `24385600`, you would run the following:
   ```
   export DAEMON_HOME=/gaia/.gaia
   export DAEMON_NAME=gaiad
   cosmovisor add-upgrade v22.1.0 gaiad-v22.1.0-linux-amd64 --upgrade-height 24385600 --force
   ```
3. Wait for the node to reach the upgrade height. Cosmovisor will restart the node using the new binary.
