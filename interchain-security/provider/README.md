# `provider` Chain Details

The provider chain functions as an analogue of the Cosmos Hub. Its governance parameters will provide short voting periods to accelerate the creation of consumer chains.

* **Chain-ID**: `provider`
* **denom**: `uatom`
* **Current Gaia Version**: [`v23.0.0-rc3`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v23.0.0-rc3), upgraded from v23.0.0-rc2 at block height `10882800`.
* **Genesis File:**  [provider-genesis.json](provider-genesis.json), verify with `shasum -a 256 provider-genesis.json`
* **Genesis sha256sum**: `91870bfb8671f5d60c303f9da8e44b620a5403f913359cc6b212150bfc3e631d`
* Launch Date: 2023-02-02
* Launch Gaia Version: [`v9.0.0-rc2`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v9.0.0-rc2)

## v23.0.0 Upgrade

The provider chain will upgrade to Gaia `v23.0.0` on **March 18, 2025**

* **Halt height: `10982300`**
  * Mintscan countdown: https://www.mintscan.io/ics-testnet-provider/block/10982300
  * Target upgrade time: `13:30 UTC`
* Release page: https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v23.0.0
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not** a governance-gated upgrade. You must do **one** of the following:
  1. Set the upgrade height in your node `app.toml` and restart the node.
     ```
     halt-height = 10982300
     ```
     * Once the halt height is reached, stop the node service and install the new binary. Set `halt-height = 0` in `app.toml` and restart your node.
  2. Restart your node with the `--halt-height 10982300` flag.
     * Once the halt height is reached, stop the node service and install the new binary. Restart your node without the `--halt-height` flag.
  3. Run the add-upgrade command with Cosmovisor
     ```
     export DAEMON_NAME=gaiad
     export DAEMON_HOME=<.gaia directory location>
     cosmovisor add-upgrade v23.0.0 gaiad-v23.0.0-linux-amd64 --upgrade-height 10982300 --force
     ```
     
     * The command above assumes that the `gaiad-v23.0.0-linux-amd64` binary is available in the current folder.

## How to Join

The scripts provided in this repo will install Gaia and optionally set up a Cosmovisor service with the auto-download feature enabled on your machine.

You can choose to (not) use state sync. Your node will sync much faster if you use state sync, but it will not keep all the state locally.

### Bash Script

Run either one of the scripts provided in this repo to join the provider chain:
* `join-ics-provider.sh` will create a `gaiad` service.
* `join-ics-provider-cv.sh` will create a `cosmovisor` service.
* Both scripts must be run either as root or from a sudoer account.
* Both scripts will attempt to build a binary from the [cosmos/gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases) repo.
* To sync with Hypha's `provider` snapshot run with the `-s` argument

#### State Sync

* By default, the scripts will attempt to use state sync to catch up quickly to the current height.

#### Sync from Genesis

To sync from genesis, you will need to start with Gaia `v9.0.0-rc2`. First, modify the bash script as follows:
* Turn off state sync by setting `STATE_SYNC` to `false`.
* Set `CHAIN_BINARY_URL` to `'https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v9.0.0-rc2/gaiad-v9.0.0-rc2-linux-amd64'`, or run `git checkout v9.0.0-rc2` if you are building from source.

Run the script, and then follow the procedure below to upgrade to the latest version:

* Stop the service
  * `systemctl stop provider`, or `systemctl stop cv-provider` if you are using Cosmovisor.
* Set `halt-height = 168100` in `~/.gaia/config/app.toml`.
