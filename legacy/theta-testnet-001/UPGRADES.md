* Estimated upgrade time: `2023-11-22 ~14:30 UTC`
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not** a governance-gated upgrade, you must set the upgrade height in your node(s) `app.toml` ahead of time:
  ```
  halt-height = "18986400"

  * After the halt height is reached and your node is stopped, replace the `gaiad` binary with the new one, set `halt-height = "0"`, and start the node again.
  * If you are using a service file, set `Restart=No` to keep the node from restarting before you have replaced the binary.

--description "This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt gaia v7.0.0 which includes a number of updates, fixes and new modules. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.\n\n# Background\n\nSince the last v6-Vega upgrade at height 86950000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint.\n\nThis is a proposal to adopt the first release candidate for the [v7-Theta](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md#v7-theta-upgrade-expected-q1-2022) upgrade on the public testnet.\n\nIt contains the following changes:\n\n* (gaia) bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.1](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.1). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.1/CHANGELOG.md#v0451---2022-02-03) for details.\n* (gaia) bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) module to [v3.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.0.0). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#v300---2022-03-15) for details.\n* (gaia) add [interchain account](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts) module (interchain-account module is part of ibc-go module).\n* (gaia) bump [liquidity](https://github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity/x/liquidity) module to [v1.5.0](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.5.0). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/blob/v1.5.0/CHANGELOG.md#v150---20220223) for details.\n* (gaia) bump [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) module to [v2.1.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v2.1.1).\n* (gaia) add migration logs for upgrade process.\n\n# On-Chain Upgrade Process\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on Cosmovisor to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. To test a simulated local upgrade please see the local testnet documentation. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height." \
